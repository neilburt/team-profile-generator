## Installation  

Simply install Node.js, open the terminal, run 'npm install' and then index.js from the directory command line.  

## Usage  

Once the application is called by typing "node index.js" in the terminal, the user just types the answers to the questions on the command line as they appear. Once finished, the team profile HTML file is produced.
